<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>

  <p> Hey everyone! I'm Amy, and I was born and raised in Houston, Texas. I am the youngest of 3 siblings and am finishing up my freshman year at The University of Texas at Austin. Ironically, I grew up hating UT because I was born and bred in an Oklahoma Sooners family, but ultimately the atmosphere of Austin and the in-state tuition brought me to UT. I am in the Business school here, but have yet to choose a major (I'm very indecisive). </p>
  <p>
  Outside of my business endeavors, I am in the Kappa Delta sorority on campus, where I have made many of my friends from this year. I am also a member of a committee that brings Distinguished Speakers to campus to talk about various topics in order to expand the horizons of students. I love being involved in these activities and am hoping to join the Undergraduate Business Council next semester as well.     
  </p>
  <p>Although I am consumed by homework and my looming future, I enjoy singing and listening to music, doing crosswords, playing sports, and watching Netflix originals in my spare time. I aspire to one day work in the entertainment industry in either music, film, or sports. The music scene and eclectic atmosphere are part of the reason I love living in Austin. <p>
    
  <p> This summer, I am working as a counselor at Camp Champions where I will hold onto my adolescence for as long as I can before I have to start taking internships and thinking about my career! I am excited for the next few years at UT and am eager to continue learning, exploring, and meeting new people. <br /><br /></p>
